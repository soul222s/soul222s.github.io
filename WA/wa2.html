    <h1> Hi, I'm Avery :D</h1>
    <p>I use she/her pronouns.</p>
    <p>My goal for this course is to <i>learn more about code in a design framework.</i></p>
    <p> I'm from Houston, Texas.</p>
    <p> I'm currently a sophomore majoring in art practices and double minoring in creative technology and design along with writing and public engagement.</p>
    <p>   <b>I love my cat, he is my everything!</b> His name is Casper and he's turning thirteen this upcoming June. <sub>He's also a big boy but that adds to his charm.</sub> </p>
      <p> My favorite youtube video is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMoXHjVBJ4c&ab_channel=chefman">yippee cat</a>. What a dapper lad. </p>
